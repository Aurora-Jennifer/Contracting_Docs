Business Formation and Insurance Status

This document provides a clear statement of my current business formation status and the remaining steps I am completing to ensure full compliance for paid consulting work.

⸻

1. Current Status

As of today:
	•	My LLC is officially formed and active in the State of Alabama. ✓
	•	My EIN has been issued. ✓
	•	My business bank account is open and active. ✓
	•	I do not yet have business insurance (General Liability or Professional Liability/E&O), which is the final remaining compliance requirement.

No billable work will begin until business insurance is obtained.

2. Steps in Progress

2.1 LLC Formation — Completed

My single-member LLC, Fox ML Infrastructure LLC, has been successfully formed and is now active.

This provides:
	•	personal liability protection
	•	proper business structure
	•	clean invoicing and contracting
	•	eligibility for insurance and business banking

2.2 EIN Registration — Completed ✓

My Employer Identification Number (EIN) has been issued and is active.

This enables:
	•	business bank account setup
	•	tax reporting
	•	formal invoicing

2.3 Business Banking — Completed ✓

A dedicated business bank account has been opened and is active, using:
	•	Articles of Organization
	•	EIN documentation

This account is used exclusively for consulting transactions.

2.4 Business Insurance — In Progress

I am currently obtaining:
	•	General Liability coverage
	•	Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage

2.5 Business Email — Planned Upgrade

After banking is finalized, a dedicated domain-backed business email (e.g., @foxinfra.com or similar) will be created to ensure:
	•	professional branding
	•	separation of personal/business communication
	•	enterprise-grade expectations

Until then, communication will continue through a temporary address.
