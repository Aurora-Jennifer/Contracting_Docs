# Business Formation and Insurance Status

This document provides a clear statement of my current business formation status and the steps I am actively completing to become fully compliant for paid consulting work.

---

## 1. Current Status

At this time:

- My **LLC has been filed** and is currently being processed by the state.  
- My **EIN has been filed** and will be issued shortly (typical issuance time: 1–4 days).  
- I do **not** yet have business insurance (General Liability or Professional Liability / E&O).

Business formation is now in its final stage. No billable work will begin until insurance, banking, and compliance steps are completed.

## 2. Steps in Progress

### 2.1 LLC Formation — *Filed, Awaiting Confirmation*
My single-member LLC has been submitted and is currently undergoing state processing.  
Once approved, this will provide:
- proper legal structure  
- personal liability protection  
- clean invoicing and contracting  
- eligibility for insurance and business banking  

### 2.2 EIN Registration — *Filed, Pending Issuance*
My Employer Identification Number (EIN) application has been filed with the IRS.  
Typical completion time is **1–4 days**, depending on IRS processing.

The EIN will support:
- tax reporting  
- invoicing  
- business bank account setup  

### 2.3 Business Insurance — *Next Step*
Once the LLC and EIN are finalized, I will obtain:
- General Liability coverage  
- Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage  

### 2.4 Business Banking — *Pending EIN*
A dedicated business bank account will be opened as soon as:
- LLC documentation is received  
- EIN is issued  

This account will be used for all consulting transactions.

### 2.5 Business Email (Planned Upgrade)
A dedicated, domain-backed business email (e.g., `@companyname.com`) will be created after banking is established to ensure:
- proper branding  
- separation of personal/business communication  
- compliance with enterprise expectations  
- secure channels  

Until then, communication occurs through a temporary address.

## 3. Expected Completion Window

Current official estimates:

- **LLC formal approval:** typically 1–10 business days from filing  
- **EIN:** typically 1–4 days from filing  
- **Insurance underwriting:** same day to 72 hours after application  
- **Business bank account:** same day once LLC documents & EIN are available  

Updates will be provided as each milestone is completed.
