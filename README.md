# Consulting & Contracting Documentation

This repository contains the standardized documents, templates, and policies used for my machine learning, quantitative research, and HPC consulting engagements.  
These materials are provided to help prospective clients evaluate my professionalism, workflow, and project structure before initiating a Statement of Work.

# Business Formation Status (Updated)

As of now:

- **Fox ML Infrastructure LLC is officially formed and active.**  
- My primary ML/infra engineering product line is now **Fox-v1-infra**.  
- **EIN issuance is pending** (filed with IRS, 1–4 day processing window).  
- A **business bank account will be opened** immediately once the EIN is issued.  
- **Business insurance (General Liability + E&O)** will be acquired after banking is established.  

No billable or contractually binding work will begin until all compliance requirements—banking, insurance, and agreement documents—are completed.

# Previous Work Showcase

The repository below demonstrates the structure, quality, and engineering rigor of my ML/quant research infrastructure.  
It represents the current evolution of what was previously the Aurora-v2 pipeline.

## Fox-v1-infra (Successor to Aurora-v2)

A production-structured ML/quant research infrastructure featuring:

- pipeline orchestration  
- leakage-safe validation  
- modular model zoo architecture  
- multi-model ensemble systems  
- reproducible config-driven workflows  
- GPU-accelerated training pipelines  
- professional-grade project layout and documentation  

Repository:  
https://github.com/Fox-ML-infrastructure/Fox-v1-infra

## Additional Public Work

More repositories are available on my profile, covering:

- modeling utilities  
- HPC workflows  
- research tooling  
- experimental infra modules  

These demonstrate my engineering style, architectural decisions, and domain expertise.

Formal contract covering payment terms, IP rights, confidentiality, warranties, and termination clauses.

### 6. `ADVANCED_OUTLINE_WIP.md`  
Working outline for multi-phase ML or HPC engagements.

### 7. `CAPABILITIES_OVERVIEW.md`  
Summarizes core competencies across ML engineering, quant infrastructure, HPC systems, and performance-critical workflows.

### 8. `IP_TERMS.md`  
Defines IP boundaries between pre-existing tools (e.g., the Fox-v1-infra stack) and client-specific deliverables.

### 9. `S&A_POLICY.md` (Security & Access Policy)

# How to Use These Documents

1. Review the repository to understand my consulting structure and capabilities.  
2. If the project appears aligned, schedule an introductory meeting to discuss goals and constraints.  
3. A customized Statement of Work (SOW) will be drafted based on the project requirements.  
4. Work begins once the SOW and Master Consulting Agreement (MCA) are approved and compliance items (LLC, EIN, insurance, banking) are complete.
