## Business Formation Status (Updated)

As of now:

- **Fox ML Infrastructure LLC is officially formed and active.** ✓  
- Primary ML/infra engineering product line: **Fox-v1-infra**.  
- **EIN has been issued.** ✓  
- **Business bank account is open and active.** ✓  
- **Business insurance (General Liability + E&O)** — Will be obtained if a client requires it. Until then, it is not feasible to maintain insurance without active client requirements.
